# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Mikayla Lin, Andrew Li

# Intentions:

We are creating an imitation of the Discord game Guess the Song where players listen to a random song and try to be the first to guess the artist and song title.

# Intended usage:

Using their terminal, players will be able to connect to the same server. After the game begins, the same random song will play on all of the player's computers. To submit a guess, players can type an artist name or the song name. First player to get each one receives points for that song. At the end, the player with the most points wins.

# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

What data structures you will be using and how.

What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.

# Intended pacing:

We believe in the natural flow of life. The universe has a path for us, and who are we to think we know better. Also, time is a social construct. "It will be a miracle if we finish" - Andrew Li, Jan 10
